## Election and Conditional Cash Transfer Program in Mexico October 12, 2022
In this HW, we analyze the data from a study that seeks to estimate the electoral impact of ‘Progresa’,
Mexico’s conditional cash transfer program (CCT program). This program has been the model for similar
programs implemented in many countries around the world where the government provides cash to low income
families conditionally on their taking some required actions. For the Progresa program the required actions
involved attending workshops regarding health behaviors and having children, particularly girls, attend
school. The impacts of the program on the intended outcomes, socioeconomic status and intergenerational
transfer of poverty, are strong. Here the interest is in a possible positive side-effect of the program on
improving voter turnout and perhaps impacting which party citizens voted for.

This exercise is based on the following two articles:
• Ana de la O. (2013). ‘Do Conditional Cash Transfers Affect Voting Behavior? Evidence from a
Randomized Experiment in Mexico.’ American Journal of Political Science, 57:1, pp.1-14; and
• Kosuke Imai, Gary King, and Carlos Velasco. (2015). ‘Do Nonpartisan Programmatic Policies Have
Partisan Electoral Effects? Evidence from Two Large Scale Randomized Experiments.’ Working Paper.
The original study relied on a randomized evaluation of the CCT program in which eligible villages were
randomly assigned to receive the program either 21 months (Early Progresa) or 6 months (Late Progresa)
before the 2000 Mexican presidential election. The government did not have the resources to provide the
Progresa program to all eligible villages when it was first decided upon. For this reason, the government
decided it was ethical to randomize provision of the program to begin early or later - this is an example of
a lagged randomized study design. The treatment is Early Progresa and the alternative is Late Progresa.
The author of the original study hypothesized that the CCT program would mobilize voters, leading to an
increase in turnout and more support for the incumbent party (PRI in this case). The analysis was based
on a sample of precincts that each contain at most one village participating in the evaluation.
